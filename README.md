Short description:
From the PhD project "Carbon Reconstructing Emulator, Parameter Estimation under Supervision", this first approach comes under the acronym "Carbon Ocean Model Parameter Learning, Early Toy Experiment".
Repository for the paper "Learning-based calibration of ocean carbon models to tackle physical forcing uncertainties and observation sparsity."

Longer description:
This project (CREPES from the french acronym "Carbone REconstruit Par Emulateur SupervisÃ©") introduces a learning approach to better constrain a biogeochemical model in a framework of sparse observations and erroneous physical forcings.
This repository contains 5 different files:
- spec-file.txt contains all the packages installed thanks to conda with the effective versions
- Dataset_Generator_DA.py To generate the data sets for the DA-based method.
- Dataset_Generator_NN.py To generate the data sets for the NN-based method.
- DA_method.py To apply the DA-based method on a data set.
- NN_method.py To train and validate a NN upon the generated data set.


For a use without errors:
1. Install the correct packages with their associated version with the spec-file.txt
   -> In the command prompt: conda create --name MyEnv  --file spec-file.txt
   -> Add the Lightning package that cannot be installed with conda: pip install https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning/archive/refs/heads/release/stable.zip -U
2. Generate the different data sets: run Dataset_Generator_NN.py and Dataset_Generator_DA.py (start with NN because DA needs mean and std of the NN data set to create its test data set)
3. Use freely the different methods (run DA_method.py or NN_method.py)
